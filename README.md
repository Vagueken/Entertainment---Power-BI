### **Case Study: Unveiling Insights in the Movie Industry Through Data Analysis**

### **Background**

You are a data analyst at BigScreen Insights, a consulting firm specializing in the movie industry. Your firm has recently acquired two extensive datasets: 'Movie Production Details' and 'Movie Revenue and Ratings'. The first dataset captures the essence of movie production, detailing various aspects such as production companies, budgets, and genres. The second set tracks the commercial performance and audience reception of these movies, offering a glimpse into their financial success and popularity.

In an industry where box office numbers and audience ratings can make or break careers, your task is pivotal. You are to delve into these datasets, uncovering patterns and insights that could redefine strategies for movie production and marketing. Your analysis will not only impact BigScreen Insights but also provide valuable guidance to your clients in the movie industry.

### **Objective**

Your mission is to use Power BI to transform these datasets into a cohesive narrative. This involves meticulous data cleaning, sophisticated data modeling, and adept use of DAX for advanced analytical insights. The culmination of your task is to build an interactive dashboard that vividly presents your findings, offering actionable insights into trends, financial viability, and audience preferences within the movie industry.

### **Dashboard Building**

**Objective**: Develop an interactive and insightful dashboard in Power BI to visualize and analyze the movie industry data.

**Tasks**:

1. Construct a multi-page dashboard with separate tabs for financial analysis, audience ratings, and genre analysis.
    - On financial analysis page, focus should be on visualizing data related to movie budgets, revenues, profits, and perhaps ROI. You may include a combo chart displaying yearly trends in average budget and average worldwide gross.
    - Audience Ratings page should focus on IMDb ratings, Rotten Tomatoes ratings, and other audience-related metrics. Visuals might include scatter plots (to compare ratings), histograms (to show distribution of ratings), and gauges (to show average ratings). For example, you may create a heatmap on the audience ratings tab to show the distribution of IMDb ratings across different star ratings.
    - Focus on the analysis of different movie genres in the Genre Analysis. Include visuals like column charts to compare the number of movies per genre, average revenue per genre, and average ratings. A treemap could be useful to display the proportion of each genre in the dataset.
